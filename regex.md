# Regex
Regex is short for Regular Expressions. It is used for pattern matching with strings. Regex is a great tool, but I don't want that tool to become a crutch because it is really easy to copy and paste regex code from the internet. But you don't learn anything by doing that. So I tend to shy away from Regex during the program, but we can touch on it here for fun.

In an overly simplified way, you can pass a method on a string and pass in characters that will make an evaluation. There are several different methods that can be used, but one is called .match and we can match for the character 'a' and pass the letter i that in Regex means that that whatever you pass in should be regarded as 'case insensitive'.

Each regex expression is a pattern enclosed in / forward slash marks
